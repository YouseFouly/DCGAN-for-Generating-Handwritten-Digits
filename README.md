# DCGAN-for-Generating-Handwritten-Digits

This repository contains a project that implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and learns to generate new images that resemble handwritten digits.

## Features
* Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the DCGAN model.
* Generates synthetic handwritten digit images using a generative model.
* Implements a Deep Convolutional GAN architecture.
* Visualizes the generator's output during training.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following installed:
* Python 
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

## Model Architecture
This DCGAN architecture consists of two main components:

* Generator: A neural network that generates new images from random noise (latent space).
* Discriminator: A neural network that classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).
The generator tries to create realistic images, while the discriminator works to distinguish between real and fake images. This adversarial process helps the generator improve over time.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is downloaded automatically when you run the notebook.

## Results
After training, the generator is able to produce synthetic images that resemble handwritten digits. You can monitor the progress of the generator by visualizing its output at different stages of training.
